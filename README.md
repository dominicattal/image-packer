This is an example of how to use [stb_pack_rect.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_rect_pack.h).

This program reads images from the images folder and tries to pack them into a bitmap with dimensions 
specified by the variables bitmap_width and bitmap_height. The program lets you know if all of the images
were packed successfully, and if not, tell you which ones failed to be packed.
